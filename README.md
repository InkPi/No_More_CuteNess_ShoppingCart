## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.
Continuation of previous work labled RPGame
It's an RPG game (role playing game). It's about you, the character, having a phoebia

3. More detailed description of items (not exactly important)


Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Landing Page | H | 4hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Cart Page | H | 8hrs| hrs | hrs |
| UserName Page | 3H | hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Total |  | hrs| hrs | hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
|  | |  


## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and their role in the project. 


## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description. 
if/else statement of when a random monster image shows up on the screen, have the correct name of the monster in text form above the image.

## jQuery Discoveries
