## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.
Continuation of previous work labled RPGame
It's an RPG game (role playing game). It's about you, the character, having a phoebia
of cute stuff and kill all cute stuff you encountered.

## Wireframes

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  
1. Landing page (most important)
2. Cart Page
3. User Page
4. Styling

## User Story

### Landing Page
Customer will go to this page and list of digital items for a game to purchase and a select down bar that select based on see a header with logo, user, and cart.

### Game Initialization
What will a player see when the game is started? 
- a fighting scene, if I don't have time to create other scenes.
- exploration map, if I have time, and encounter random cute monsters

### Playing The Game
What will be the flow of the game, what will the user be expeted to do and what will the user expect from the gam
-User encounter various cute enemies and need to exterminate as much as possible. He 
has a set level and hp. Enemies are various levels and hp but generally user is stronger.

### Winning The Game
What does it look like when the game ends, what determines winning or losing?
Game ends when user's hp reached 0. Show status of how many killed afterwards.

### Game Reset
How will the user restart the game once it has been completed.
There will be a button at the end that says "restart?" How do I restart while keeping
score?

## MVP 

Include the full list of features that will be part of your MVP
1. Landing Page :
    User tab
    Cart tab
    Main page of static images of products and select drop menu to type of item

2. Fighting scene : 
    Enemy would be random
3. Able to restart game after ending

## POST MVP
1. Exploring Map:
    Player run around map, encountering enemies by leading to fighting scene
2. Keeping Score of Player's kill and keep in storage forever

Include the full list of features that you are considering for POST MVP
## Functional Components
1. Exploration Map : 
    User explore map. Encounter random enemies.
2. Status Score page :
    Keep score while being able to restart
    Highest score on top
3. Potions : User, by 50% chance, get potion from defeating monsters
4. Experience points: User gains experience points from defeating monsters.
    Experience points differ from monster and levels.
    Enough points let you level up.



Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 
    Multiple functions.
    JQuery DOM: getting nodes and storing them to use them such as player.
    CSS transition/ animations
    If/else statements for 
    Extends, constructor, super for same type enemies w/ diff stats(lvls, attack, and hp)
    .innerHTML change for hp level
    z-index for css
    ? Method for keeping score after restarting game
    Random floor, random math for enemy encounters and their stats
    For loop for highest score?

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Landing Page | H | 4hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Cart Page | H | 8hrs| hrs | hrs |
| UserName Page | 3H | hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Total |  | hrs| hrs | hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
|  | |  


## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and their role in the project. 


## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description. 
if/else statement of when a random monster image shows up on the screen, have the correct name of the monster in text form above the image.

## jQuery Discoveries
 Use this section to list some, but not all, of the jQuery methods and\or functionality discovered while working on this project.


## Change Log
 Section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.
